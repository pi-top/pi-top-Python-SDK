    """Represents a pi-top Device.

    When creating a `Pitop` object, multiple properties will be set,
    depending on the pi-top device that it's running the code. For example, if run on
    a pi-top [4], a `miniscreen` attribute will be created as an interface to control the
    miniscreen OLED display, but that won't be available for other pi-top devices.

    The Pitop class is a Singleton. This means that only one instance per process will
    be created. In practice, this means that if in a particular project you instance a Pitop
    class in 2 different files, they will share the internal state.

    *property* miniscreen
        If using a pi-top [4], this property returns a :class:`pitop.miniscreen.Miniscreen` object, to interact with the device's Miniscreen.


    *property* oled
        Refer to `miniscreen`.


    *property* battery
        If using a pi-top with a battery, this property returns a :class:`pitop.battery.Battery` object, to interact with the device's battery.
