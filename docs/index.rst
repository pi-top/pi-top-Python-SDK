--------------------------
Status: Active Development
--------------------------

This SDK is currently in active development, and is made publicly available to inspect while it is being developed.

Please do not expect anything to be final, working or understandable until it has matured, ready for release.

Backwards Compatibility
=======================

When this library reaches v1.0.0, we will aim to maintain backwards-compatibility thereafter. Until then, every effort will be made to ensure stable support, but it cannot be guaranteed. Breaking changes will be clearly documented.

About
-----

This SDK aims to provide an easy-to-use framework for managing a pi-top. It includes a Python 3 package (`pitop`),

with several modules for interfacing with a range of pi-top devices and peripherals It also contains CLI utilities,
to interact with your pi-top using the terminal.

The SDK is included out-of-the-box with pi-topOS.

Ensure that you keep your system up-to-date to enjoy the latest features and bug fixes.

This library is installed as a Python 3 module called `pitop`. It includes several
submodules that allow you to easily interact with most of the hardware inside a pi-top.

You can easily connect different components of the system using the
modules available in the library:


.. code-block:: python

    from time import sleep
    from pitop.pma import UltrasonicSensor
    from pitop.miniscreen import OLED

    oled = OLED()
    utrasonic = PMAUltrasonicSensor("D1")

    while True:
        distance = utrasonic.distance
        oled.draw_multiline_text(str(distance))
        sleep(0.1)

This repository also contains a 'pi-top' command-line interface (CLI) for some SDK functionality:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pi-top oled write "Hey! I'm a $(pt devices hub)"


A 'pt' alias is also provided for quicker typing:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ pt oled write "Hey! I'm a $(pt devices hub)"
