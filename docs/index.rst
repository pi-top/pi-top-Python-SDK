About
=====

The goal of this library is to allow new and experienced users alike to get working with a variety of component types (see `here
<https://knowledgebase.pi-top.com/knowledge/foundation-plate-explained>`_ for more details). `gpiozero
<https://gpiozero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_, as the standard library for Raspberry Pi GPIO programming in Python, is either used directly or its style is mimicked to ensure that best practices are followed and a single intuitive paradigm is maintained.

This library is included out-of-the-box with pi-topOS.

Ensure that you keep your system up-to-date to enjoy the latest features and bug fixes.
