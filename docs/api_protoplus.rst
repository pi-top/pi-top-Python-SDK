=====================================

This module has been designed to allow a programmer to utilise keyboard input in the same way as
they might use GPIO input (e.g. a button).

You can listen for any standard keyboard key input, for example by using ``a`` or ``A`` to listen
for the A-key being pressed with or without shift.
