class LightSensor(ADCBase):
    """Encapsulates the behaviour of a light sensor module.

    A simple analogue photo transistor is used to detect the intensity of the light striking
    the sensor. The component contains a photoresistor which detects light intensity. The
    resistance decreases as light intensity increases; thus the brighter the light, the
    higher the voltage.

    Uses an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) to turn the analog reading from the sensor
    into a digital value.

    By default, the sensor uses 3 samples to report a :attr:`~.LightSensor.reading`, which takes around 0.5s.
    This can be changed by modifying the parameter :attr:`~.LightSensor.number_of_samples` in the constructor.

    :param str port_name: The ID for the port to which this component is connected
    :param str number_of_samples: Amount of sensor samples used to report a :attr:`~.LightSensor.reading`. Defaults to 3.
    :param str name: Component name, defaults to `light_sensor`. Used to access this component when added to a :class:`pitop.Pitop` object.
