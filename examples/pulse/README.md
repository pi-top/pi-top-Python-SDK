# pi-topPULSE examples

## cputemp.py
Displays the CPU temperature in celsius on the pi-topPULSE's LED matrix.

* Kindly provided by Rene Richarz
* Based on [the script to display digits on the sense hat by yaab-arduino.blogspot.ch](http://yaab-arduino.blogspot.co.uk/2016/08/display-two-digits-numbers-on-raspberry.html)

## led-demo.py
Demonstrates multiple pattern effects that can be produced on a pi-topPULSE.

* based on Unicorn Hat's LED demo code

## led-pong-demo.py
Demonstrates a pong game clone on a pi-topPULSE.

## mic-demo.py
Demonstrates capturing different audio formats to WAV files using the onboard microphone on a pi-topPULSE.

## pt-pulse-battery
Visually shows a pi-top's remaining battery level on the pi-topPULSE's LED matrix.

*NOTE: This script requires `pt-hub` to be installed to communicate with a pi-top hub's battery.*

## showdigits.py
Demonstrates how to show multiple pattern effects that can be produced on a pi-topPULSE.

* Kindly provided by Rene Richarz

## showusage.py
Shows current CPU usage of the Raspberry Pi's 4 cores on the pi-topPULSE's LED matrix.

* Kindly provided by Rene Richarz

## testcolors.py
Demonstrates colour representation of the pi-topPULSE's LED matrix by displaying 49 different colour intensities in the 49 pixels of the LED matrix.

* Kindly provided by Rene Richarz

*NOTE: Due to the way that the hardware works, each colour is 5 bits. Therefore, multiple pixels have the same intensity.*
