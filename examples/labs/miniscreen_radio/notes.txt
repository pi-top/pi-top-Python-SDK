Useful terminal commands:
Check on the general status of the media player client with’ mpc status’

If you fuck up the OLED in code, you can fix things by restarting first the device manager service, and then the OLED service:
sudo systemctl restart pt-device-manager.service
sudo systemctl restart pt-sys-oled.service
