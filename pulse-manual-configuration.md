## Manually Configuring Raspbian for pi-topPULSE

**Note:** This document was moved here from the Github project wiki.
**Note:** This is definitely the long way round to get the pi-topPULSE working, and is provided only for interest. If you are running pi-topOS, you do not need to worry about this - everything is already included! If you are running Raspbian, please consult the `readme.md` file [here](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-topPULSE/blob/master/README.md) for the simpler method of enabling the pulse.

### Enabling I2C

I2C is required to communicate with the function-enabling IC as part of initialisation.

The simplest way to do this is by running `raspi-config`, selecting `Interfacing Options` → `I2C` → Select "Yes" to enabling I2C.

### Enabling UART/serial for LEDs and Microphone

The included version of Pyserial on Raspbian on Python 3 does not support custom baud rates, which is required for LEDs to work. Run the `upgrade-python3-pyserial` script in the [manual-install](/manual-install/@master) folder to update to the latest version of Pyserial.

You will also need to enable UART. The simplest way to do this is by running `raspi-config`, selecting `Interfacing Options` → `Serial` → Select "No" to enabling a login shell accessible over serial  → Select "Yes" for enabling serial port hardware.

### Configuring Audio Output (Speaker)

##### Enabling HDMI to I2S on the pi-top v2

The new pi-top has built-in HDMI-to-I2S audio conversion, which eliminates the need for reconfiguring the operating system to use I2S. Enabling this requires communicating with the hub, which can be as follows:

    sudo apt install python3-pt-common

Now you can use [pt-hdmi-to-i2s](https://github.com/pi-top/pi-topHUB-v2/blob/master/manual-install/pt-hdmi-to-i2s) as follows:

    pt-hdmi-to-i2s enable
    pt-hdmi-to-i2s disable

##### Configuring I2S on the original pi-top (v1) and pi-topCEED

I2S enabling/disabling and volume control configuration on the original pi-top (v1) and pi-topCEED form part of the [general pi-top device management system](https://github.com/pi-top/Device-Management), however can be configured manually via the following commands, followed by a reboot, using [pt-i2s](https://github.com/pi-top/Device-Management/blob/master/src/i2s/pt-i2s):

    pt-i2s enable
    pt-i2s disable

Volume control for pi-topPULSE can be enabled by loading soundcard device information with the following command (with a pi-topPULSE connected, and with I2S enabled), followed by a reboot, using [hifiberry-alsactl.restore](https://github.com/pi-top/Device-Management/blob/master/src/i2s/hifiberry-alsactl.restore):

    /usr/sbin/alsactl -f hifiberry-alsactl.restore restore

### Making the `ptpulse` Python library accessible

The easiest way to get the pi-topPULSE library is to install the debian package directly:

    sudo apt install python3-pt-pulse

You can also download the library files from this repository and use them locally.

## Using the software library to manually initialise pi-topPULSE

Once you have installed the library, you can now initialise the device:

    from ptpulse import configuration as ptpulsecfg

    host_device_id = 2
    ptpulsecfg.initialise(host_device_id)
    enabled, reboot_required, v2_hub_hdmi_to_i2s_required = ptpulsecfg.enable_device()

    if (reboot_required):
        print("Reboot required")
    elif (v2_hub_hdmi_to_i2s_required):
        print("HDMI to I2S required")
    elif (enabled):
        print("Successfully enabled pi-topPULSE")
    else:
        print("Failed to enable pi-topPULSE")

** NOTE: the host device ID for your device can be found [here](https://github.com/pi-top/Device-Management/blob/master/library/ptcommon/common_ids.py)**

## Using pi-topPULSE in projects

You are now ready to use the pi-topPULSE! Check out the [examples](/examples@master) folder to get some inspiration of how you can use it.
